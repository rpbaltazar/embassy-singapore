In 2014 the Office for the Investor of the Portuguese Diaspora was opened to provide support for members of the Portuguese Diaspora wishing to invest in Portugal. You may find a brief presentation of the Office [here]({{ pcurl('docs/GAIDEN.pdf') }}).

An online networking platform named 560.pt, accessible via the website [www.560emnegocios.pt]({{'http://www.560emnegocios.pt'}}), has been made available to the entrepreneurs of the Portuguese Diaspora to facilitate networking opportunities aimed at the establishment of business contacts.
