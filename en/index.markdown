The Portuguese Embassy in Singapore was created in October 2009 with the dual purposes of strengthening the political, economic and cultural relationships between both countries and providing consular assistance to the many Portuguese citizens that live in or visit Singapore.

Meeting these purposes has been the main task and constant daily activity of the Embassy over the past years, which has resulted in the following:

 - The first presidential visit of a Portuguese Head of State to Singapore on May 27 and 28 2012. This visit was reciprocated on 5 and 6 of May of 2014, when the President of Singapore, His Excellency Tony Tan, undertook a state visit to Portugal;
 - The December 2011 creation of the Portuguese Business Council in Singapore (CEPS) which gathers the representatives from all Portuguese companies with locations in Singapore, as well as Singapore-based Portuguese executives of multinational companies. In order to reinforce and solidify its activity, this informal structure gave way to a legal entity, the PBS - Portuguese Business Society of Singapore, established in January 2014;
 - Signature of 3 Bilateral Agreements in the field of finance, air transportation, culture, education, media and sports;
 - Support to Portuguese companies that seek to promote their products in Singapore;
 and
 - Administrative and consular departments with quick and personalized services. For instance, getting a Portuguese Passport in the Embassy takes less than one week.

Despite resources limited by the financial adjustment program that Portugal is executing, this Embassy will continue to give its best to promote relations with the Singaporean authorities and society as well as supporting Portuguese companies and citizens living in Singapore.
