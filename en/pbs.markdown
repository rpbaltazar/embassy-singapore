The Portuguese Business Society is a formal association working towards creating a contact network between Portuguese companies and executives present in Singapore, with the objectives of facilitating business relationships between Portuguese and Singaporean companies and promoting Portuguese businesses in this country and beyond.

The Society also provides information and assistance to Portuguese companies looking into entering the Singaporean market. After two years of preparatory work as CEPS â€“ Portuguese Business Council of Singapore, a voluntary association, this entity evolved into a fees based organisation, the PBS, open to all individuals and companies via individual and corporate memberships.

We would like to recall that CEPS produced the document "Recommendations for settling in Singapore", focused on supporting companies and highly skilled Portuguese professionals that want to move in.
This document is [available here]({{'http://www.embaixadasingapura.com/docs/ceps.pdf'}})(in portuguese only).

The current President of the PBS's Executive Committee is Mr Gil de Botton, regional representative of Logoplaste, a Portuguese multinational manufacturing company. The Ambassador of Portugal in Singapore is an honorary member.
