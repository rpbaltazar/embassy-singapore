<u>Register a Birth:</u>

The birth of an individual who has rights to Portuguese nationality must be registered in the Council of his or her area. 

Birth registration is made upon the parents' declaration or by transcription, based on a birth certificate issued by local authorities of the country where the birth occurred. In the former case, the parent(s) must be enrolled in the counsular services.

The birth registration can be done by someone who is identified properly and is the legal representative of the registrant, or by a proxy who is authorized to do so.

If the birth occurred more than 14 years ago, the registration can only be made by organizing the authorization procedure for late registration of birth.

<strong>Important</strong>: in case of birth registration by transcription, the presence of the parents or an authorized representative is mandatory. 

<u>Required documents:</u>
 - Identity card/ birth certificate issued less than 6 months ago of the legal representatives
 - The child's birth certificate, in case of registration by transcription

<strong>Note</strong>: to make the declaration of the birth registration in the Counsular, is advisable to provide previous notice by calling the Embassy.
The presence of the registrant (baby) is not mandatory.
