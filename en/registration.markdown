The Portuguese citizens living abroad should begin by registering with the Portuguese Council, as it is a necessary requirement for obtaining any documents. 

Registration is a consular act, in which the identification of a national citizen is recorded in the archives of the Consular post of his or her residence area, or where the citizen is occasionally staying. 

For registration, it is mandatory that the national citizen be physically present. The exception is children under 10 years old, who can be registered if requested by their legal representative(s), whose presence constitutes proof that the minors are currently in the jurisdiction area of the consular post.

Consular registration is proved by the certificate of registration. 

<u>Requested documents</u>:

- Identity Card (mandatory)
- Passport (non-mandatory)
- 1 recent Colour face photo
- Nationality certificate, issued by the Portuguese authorities, for children under 10 who are not holders of an identity card

<strong>Note</strong>: When a citizen does not possess valid ID, he or she may be issued a temporary consular registration certificate upon the presentation of a valid national passport. In these cases, any other documents that require the presentation of the Identity Card cannot be issued.
