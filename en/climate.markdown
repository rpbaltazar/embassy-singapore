Portugal has, usually, a temperate climate with average daytime temperatures between 8ºC and 18ºC in winter and between 16ºC and 30ºC in summer. However, the differences between North and South, the coast and interior are in certain seasons, quiet sharp.

The North records the highest rainfall and lowest averages annual temperatures. But it is in the interior that occurs the largest temperature ranges. At the South of Tejo there are well-known Mediterranean influences, with very long hot summers and short winters with little rainfall. Madeira has a Mediterranean-type climate with soft and pleasant temperatures throughout the year, while the Azores islands have a maritime climate with abundant rainfall.
