The History of the foundation of Portugal dates back to 1143. Its continental border, virtually unchanged since the thirteenth century, made Portugal one of the oldest countries in the world and reflects its identity mark and internal unity.

Its location along 840 km of Atlantic coastline, soon determined the maritime vocation of its people. In the early XV century, Portugal began the most epic journeys ever undertaken, which would make them famous by the discovery of sea routes to India, Brazil, China and Japan, tearing the limits of the world and allowing a globalizing mixing of cultures.

In the third quarter of the eighteenth century Portugal entered the path of modernization. In the light of economic interventionism and cultural enlightenment the State structures were reorganized and the sectors of industry and commerce were restructured.

In the transition to the nineteenth century revolutionary winds that blew from America and France. Those winds and others coming from a Spanish movement to restore the Constitution reached Portugal. 

These and other circumstances gave an extraordinary impulse to the constitutionalist Portuguese movement, with the Portuguese liberals increasingly seeing the need for a constitution that created a new legal and political order that give limited the power of the king and guarantee individual rights.

In this context arises the Constitution of 1822, out of the Cortes of 1820. It is the oldest and one of the most technically well prepared Portuguese constitutional texts. This text is considered the beginning of the democratic and modern constitutionalist Portuguese movement, (which lead to the end of the traditional monarchy, to the independence of Brazil and to the implementation of constitutional monarchy in Portugal).

The turn of the twentieth century was marked by the destabilization of the political life and  it would lead to the establishment of the Republic in 1910. Portugal participated in the First World War alongside the Allies. In the mid-twenties, the economic and financial situation of the country was bad and in this context, emerged the "New State" marked by corporatism and authoritarianism with the suppression of democratic freedoms.

On April 25, 1974, the Armed Forces Movement overthrew the New State's regime, in power since 1933, paving the way for democracy and a new cycle of economic and social openness.

We are part of the EU since 1986, but we continue to value our own virtues, keeping a close link with the other seven Portuguese-speaking countries: Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and East Timor.

The Portugal of  the XXI Century is a country with social and political stability, capable of asserting itself in a globalized world and an important bridge between different cultures, the result of centuries of close interaction with various people.
