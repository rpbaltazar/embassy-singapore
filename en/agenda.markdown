The Embassy of Portugal in Singapore is pleased to inform you that between 13 and 24 of May will take place the European Union Film Festival (EUFF) in GV Suntec City (3 Temasek Boulevard # 03-373 Suntec City Mall Singapore 038983 - East Atrium , next to Tower 4, Level 3).

The EUFF is an annual event that features a selection of European films, giving the local public a sample of the diversity and European creativity.

This event, now in its 25th year, is a window into the intriguing world of European cinema, as well as an opportunity to improve the exposure of local talent, making it as the oldest foreign film festival in Singapore.

This year Portugal will participate with the film "Consul of Bordeaux", a film by Jo√£o Correia and Francisco Manso, which premiered in 2011 and tells the story of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, Consul of Bordeaux in 1940, by the time of the Second World War. By the time, it were issued about 30,000 visas - including 10,000 for Jews - to ensure refugee entry into Portugal and defying direct orders of its government.

Tickets can be purchased at GV Suntec City or through [the GV website] ({{'http://www.gv.com.sg/GVGroupSynopsis#/group/c0b28468-624b-41b4-b86f-1574ad9d116c'}} )
